        'The status bar belongs to the operating system, not the app — it reports the clock, network, and battery at the very top of the screen. Apps do not draw it, but they do choose whether their content draws behind it (edge-to-edge) and whether its icons are light or dark for contrast.\n\nRespecting the "safe area" so content is not hidden under the status bar (and the notch/camera cutout) is a core part of mobile layout. Getting this wrong is the classic "content clipped at the top" bug.',

It tells users where they are and what they can do here.\n\nOn Material it is the "top app bar"; on iOS the "navigation bar".
