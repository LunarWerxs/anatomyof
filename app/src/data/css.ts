For that reason a `<link>` tag in the HTML `<head>` is usually preferred — it lets the browser discover and fetch stylesheets in parallel instead of serially.",

Because they resolve at compute time, they can also be changed dynamically from JavaScript or animated, which static preprocessor variables cannot do.',
