A module bundles together its types, imports, functions, memories, tables, globals, and exports as ordered sections.\n\nModules are the unit of validation and instantiation: the host (a browser, `wasmtime`, `wasmer`, etc.) parses and validates the whole module before a single instruction runs, which is why Wasm has a reputation for failing fast and loud rather than corrupting memory quietly.',

Wasm has exactly four core value types: `i32`, `i64`, `f32`, `f64` (plus newer additions like `v128` and reference types).\n\nThis is also the backbone of `call_indirect`, which checks the callee\'s actual signature against the expected `type` at runtime — the closest thing Wasm has to a vtable check, and the reason a mismatched function-pointer call traps instead of jumping into the weeds.',

Functions are referenced by index or, in WAT, by a friendlier `$name` identifier that the assembler resolves to an index for you.\n\nUnlike most assembly, a Wasm function body is structured — `block`, `loop`, and `if` provide control flow instead of arbitrary jumps, which is precisely what lets validators check a module in a single linear pass instead of needing full control-flow-graph analysis like a native disassembler does.',
