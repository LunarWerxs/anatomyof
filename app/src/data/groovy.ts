A handful of packages (`java.lang`, `java.util`, `java.io`, `groovy.lang`, and a few others) are imported automatically, so common types are already in scope.\n\nGroovy also supports static imports (`import static Math.PI`) and wildcard imports (`import java.util.*`), letting a file pull in exactly the surface area it needs.',

        '`class` declares a new type much like Java, but with less boilerplate: Groovy auto-generates a public no-arg constructor (when none is written), getters and setters for every property, and a sensible `toString()` unless you override them yourself. Fields default to `public` unless you add an explicit modifier.\n\nGroovy classes compile to ordinary `.class` files, so a Groovy class can extend a Java class, implement a Java interface, or be extended by Java code in the same project — the two languages coexist in the same build without friction.',

A field declared with `def` instead, like `def age = 30`, is dynamically typed: its declared type is effectively `Object`, and it can hold anything at runtime.\n\nBecause Groovy treats fields as properties by default, `person.name = "Bob"` and `person.setName("Bob")` are interchangeable — the dot-assignment form is just syntax sugar over the generated setter.',

This is Groovy leaning into its scripting roots: quick to write, forgiving to refactor, and popular for exactly that reason in Gradle build files and Jenkins pipelines.\n\nStatic typing remains available side by side: writing `LocalDate today = LocalDate.now()` instead of `def` gets compile-time checks, and `@TypeChecked` or `@CompileStatic` on a class or method escalates that checking (and performance) closer to Java's.",

Closures capture variables from their enclosing scope by reference, so they can read and modify state defined outside themselves.\n\nClosures are Groovy's workhorse for collection methods (`list.each { println it }`, `list.collect { it * 2 }`) and for DSLs like Gradle's build scripts, where nearly every configuration block is secretly a closure being handed to a method.",

This sidesteps writing a matching constructor overload for every combination of fields you might want to set.\n\nA conventional positional constructor still works too if the class defines one explicitly, and both styles can coexist on the same class.",

Bracket access, `config['env']` or the shorthand `config.env`, works on both.\n\nThese literals lean on Groovy's broader collection API — methods like `.each`, `.collect`, `.find`, and `.sort` are added onto every `List` and `Map`, so filtering or transforming a collection rarely needs an explicit loop.",
