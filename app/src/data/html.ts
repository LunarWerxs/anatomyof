Comments can span multiple lines and are stripped from the accessibility tree and rendered output entirely, though they remain visible to anyone who views the page source.\n\nThey are commonly used to label sections of a long document, leave notes for other developers, or temporarily disable a block of markup while debugging. Unlike server-side templating comments, HTML comments are still sent to the client, so they are not a place to hide sensitive information.',

      details:
        '`<!DOCTYPE html>` must be the very first line of an HTML5 document. It is not an HTML tag but an instruction to the browser to render the page in standards mode rather than quirks mode, which older, doctype-less documents triggered for backward compatibility with pre-CSS layouts.\n\nQuirks mode changes box-model math, table sizing, and other layout behaviors in ways that are hard to predict, so omitting or misplacing the doctype can silently break a modern layout. The HTML5 doctype is deliberately short compared to the versioned, DTD-referencing doctypes required by HTML 4.01 and XHTML.',

      details:
        '`<html>` is the single top-level element that wraps the entire document; every other element, including `<head>` and `<body>`, nests inside it. Its `lang` attribute (e.g. `lang="en"`) declares the document\'s primary language, which screen readers use to choose pronunciation rules and browsers use for features like spell-check and translation prompts.\n\nA document with more than one `<html>` element, or markup outside it, is invalid; browsers will still attempt to recover and render something reasonable, but validators and some tooling will flag it. The closing `</html>` tag marks the end of the parsed document.',

      details:
        '`<head>` holds information about the document rather than content the user sees directly: character encoding, viewport configuration, the page title, linked stylesheets, and `<script>` or `<meta>` tags used by browsers, search engines, and social media crawlers. Almost nothing inside `<head>` renders visibly on the page itself.\n\nBecause the browser reads `<head>` before it can safely start painting `<body>`, large synchronous resources referenced there (like blocking scripts) can delay first render. That is why stylesheets are typically linked in `<head>` but non-critical scripts are often deferred or moved before `</body>`.',

        '`<meta charset="UTF-8">` declares the character encoding so the browser decodes bytes into text correctly; it should appear within the first 1024 bytes of the file. `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">` tells mobile browsers to render at the device\'s actual width instead of faking a desktop-sized layout and zooming out, which is essential for responsive design. `<title>` sets the text shown in the browser tab and used as the default bookmark or search-result headline.\n\n`<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">` attaches an external CSS file to the document; `<link>` is also used for favicons (`rel="icon"`) and preconnect/preload hints. All of these elements normally live in `<head>` and, aside from the tab title, produce no visible output on their own.',

Values are conventionally quoted with double quotes, and most attributes are optional with sensible defaults; a few, like `alt` on `<img>`, are effectively required for accessibility even though the parser will not reject their absence.\n\nSome attributes are boolean and need no value at all — their mere presence turns the behavior on, e.g. `<input disabled>` or `<script defer>`. Global attributes like `class`, `id`, and `data-*` are valid on virtually any element, while others, like `href`, only make sense on specific elements such as `<a>` or `<link>`.',

Before HTML5, developers approximated all of these with generic `<div id="header">`-style markup that carried no inherent meaning.\n\nUsing the correct semantic element gives screen readers and other assistive technology landmarks to jump between, and gives search engines stronger signals about page structure, at no cost to how the element looks by default (they render essentially like `<div>` unless styled).',
