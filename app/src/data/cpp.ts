Because `<<` is overloaded for every built-in type and for `std::string`, the same syntax works whether you are printing numbers, text, or custom types that define their own overload.\n\n`endl` writes a newline and flushes the stream\'s buffer; `"\\n"` also writes a newline but without the forced flush, so it is typically cheaper in output-heavy code. The matching input stream, `cin`, reads from standard input using the extraction operator `>>`.',

Since C++17, `if` can also carry an init-statement (`if (auto it = find(...); it != end)`), scoping a helper variable to the condition and its branches.',
