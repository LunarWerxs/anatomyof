      details:
        'Everything outside `<?php ... ?>` is sent to the output verbatim as plain text, which is what lets a `.php` file mix HTML markup and PHP logic in the same document — a template can drop in and out of PHP mode as many times as it needs. `<?php` (with the trailing space or newline) is the canonical form; the short echo tag `<?=` is also common for printing a single expression inline in a template.\n\nA shorthand `<?` tag exists but is disabled by default (`short_open_tag`) on most installations, so `<?php` is the only form that is guaranteed to work everywhere. Because the tag itself is what triggers execution, a stray `<?php` earlier in a file that was meant to stay HTML is a classic source of accidental code execution.',

A `/* ... */` block comments out everything between the delimiters, including multiple lines, but cannot be nested.\n\nDocumentation comments written as `/** ... */` (two asterisks) follow the same PHPDoc convention as Javadoc — tags like `@param` and `@return` describe a function's signature for humans and for IDE tooling, even though PHP itself never checks them at runtime.",

It groups related classes, functions, and constants under a prefix, so two libraries can each define a class named `User` without colliding, as long as they live in different namespaces.\n\nNamespaces are separated with a backslash, mirroring the directory-like structure most autoloaders (including Composer's PSR-4 standard) expect: `MyProject\\Models\\User` typically resolves to a file at `src/Models/User.php`. Code outside the namespace refers back to it with a fully qualified name or a `use` import.",

Traits (`use SomeTrait;` inside the class body) offer a form of horizontal code reuse for when inheritance alone will not fit.',

Marking a property `readonly` (PHP 8.1+) additionally forbids changing it after it is first set.',

Inside an instance method, `$this` refers to the object the method was called on and is how the body reaches the object's own properties, e.g. `$this->name`.",

Variables need no declaration; assigning to `$alice` the first time creates it, and its type is whatever value it currently holds rather than something fixed up front.\n\nVariables are function-scoped by default — a variable created inside a function is invisible outside it, and a global variable is likewise invisible inside a function unless explicitly imported with `global $name;` or captured by a closure's `use (...)` clause.",

Every object lives on the heap and is accessed through a reference — assigning `$bob = $alice` copies the reference, so both variables point at the same underlying object, while `clone $alice` produces an independent copy.\n\nBuilt-in classes are instantiated the same way as user-defined ones, as in `new DateTime()` for the current date and time. PHP\'s garbage collector reclaims an object automatically once nothing references it any longer; there is no manual `free`.',

Reaching into an object property or array element needs the curly-brace form, `"{$this->name}"` or `"{$items[\'key\']}"`, so the parser knows exactly where the expression ends.\n\nInterpolation is generally preferred over concatenation with `.` for readability when mixing several variables into one string, though both compile to the same underlying operation and neither is meaningfully faster than the other in modern PHP.',
