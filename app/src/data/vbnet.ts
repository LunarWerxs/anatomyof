There is no dedicated block-comment syntax — a multi-line explanation just means prefixing every line with its own apostrophe, which is very on-brand for a language descended from BASIC's `REM` statement.\n\nThe legacy keyword `REM` still works as a comment marker for historical compatibility, but essentially no VB.NET code written this century uses it; the apostrophe is the idiomatic form in every style guide and every IDE snippet.",

Both are closed with their own matching `End Module` / `End Class`, and a single file may declare several of either.',

        '`Dim greeting As String = "Hello, VB.NET!"` declares a variable with an explicit type using the `As` clause. With `Option Strict On` (recommended in every project template since VB 2005), the compiler enforces that type and disallows silent narrowing conversions; without it, VB.NET quietly falls back to its dynamically-typed `Variant`-like heritage, for better or worse.\n\n`Const MaxCount As Integer = 3` declares a compile-time constant that cannot be reassigned. Unlike `Dim`, a `Const` must be initialized at declaration and its value must be resolvable at compile time — no calling a function to produce it.',

Every `Sub` block closes with `End Sub`, and like most VB.NET block keywords this pairing is enforced by the compiler, not just a style convention.',
