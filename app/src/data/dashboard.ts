It stays put as content changes, giving users a stable map of where they are and where they can go.\n\nDashboards favour a sidebar over a horizontal nav because they are dense, data-heavy apps used for long sessions — vertical space is cheap and the extra room lets labels and icons coexist. On narrow screens it typically collapses to icons or a hamburger.',

In data-heavy tools it is often the fastest path to anything, so it earns a prominent, always-visible spot in the top bar.\n\nGood dashboard search is scoped and typo-tolerant, shows results grouped by type, and supports keyboard shortcuts (a slash or ⌘K) since power users live in these tools all day.',
