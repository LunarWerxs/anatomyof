Comments are stripped entirely before compilation and carry zero runtime cost.',

Without the `open`, every reference to a module's contents needs the qualified form.\n\nBecause `open` can shadow existing names silently, style guides often prefer a local `let open Printf in ...` or the `Module.(expr)` syntax to scope the effect narrowly, reserving a top-level `open` for modules like `Printf` or `Stdlib` submodules that are used pervasively.",

        '`let` binds a name to a value, and a function is just a value whose type happens to be an arrow (`int -> int`). Ordinary `let` bindings cannot refer to themselves — `let rec` is required whenever the definition needs to recurse, as in `let rec factorial n = ...`.\n\nBecause functions are ordinary values, they can be passed as arguments, returned from other functions, and partially applied by supplying fewer arguments than the function expects, which yields a new function waiting for the rest.',

Patterns can destructure tuples, records, and variant constructors in one step, binding sub-values directly.\n\nThe compiler performs exhaustiveness checking: if a `match` fails to cover every possible constructor of a variant type, it emits a warning at compile time, turning a whole category of runtime crashes into a build-time signal instead.',

This is different from a top-level `let`, which extends to the rest of the file or module.\n\nBecause everything in OCaml is an expression, `let ... in` chains naturally: each binding's scope is exactly the rest of the enclosing expression, which is why deeply nested logic often reads as a sequence of small named steps rather than a block of statements.",
