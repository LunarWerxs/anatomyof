TypeScript uses structural typing: any object with a compatible shape satisfies `Person`, whether or not it was ever declared to `implement` it, unlike the nominal typing of languages such as Java.\n\nInterfaces can extend other interfaces (`interface Employee extends Person`), be reopened later in the same scope to add more members (declaration merging), and are generally preferred over `type` aliases for object shapes that a class might `implement` or that library consumers might extend.',

        "A type annotation follows a colon after a name — `name: string`, `age: number` — and tells the compiler exactly what type is allowed there. The compiler checks every assignment and usage against the annotation and reports an error before the code ever runs, catching mismatches that would otherwise surface only as bugs in production JavaScript.\n\nAnnotations are purely a compile-time construct: `tsc` strips every `: Type` when it emits JavaScript, so there is no runtime cost and no way to inspect a variable's declared type at runtime. This is what makes TypeScript a strict superset rather than a different language — valid JavaScript is (almost always) valid TypeScript with the types simply left off.",

A class can implement several interfaces at once, separated by commas, and can also `extend` exactly one base class to inherit its members.\n\nUnlike an interface, a class produces real runtime code: fields become properties on `this`, and methods are shared through the prototype chain exactly as in plain JavaScript. `implements` is checked only at compile time and leaves no trace in the emitted output — it never appears in the compiled JavaScript.',

The verbose example spells the assignments out explicitly for clarity, but parameter properties are the more idiomatic, shorter form.',

Methods can carry their own visibility modifiers (`public`, `private`, `protected`) to control whether they are callable from outside the class.',

This is identical to the JavaScript feature TypeScript compiles down to — template literals add no type-checking behavior of their own beyond checking that the interpolated expressions are well-typed.\n\nTemplate literals can also span multiple lines without escape sequences, unlike ordinary quoted strings. TypeScript separately offers "template literal types" (a type-level feature using the same backtick syntax) for building string literal types out of unions, but that is a distinct, compile-time-only concept from the runtime string interpolation shown here.',

Optional parameters (`age?: number`) and default values (`age: number = 0`) can further refine a function's accepted arguments.",

      details:
        '`const` and `let` behave exactly as they do in JavaScript — block-scoped, with `const` preventing reassignment of the binding — but TypeScript layers static typing on top. `const employees: Employee[] = [...]` explicitly annotates the array element type, so pushing anything other than an `Employee` into it is a compile error.\n\nAn explicit annotation is not always necessary: TypeScript can often determine the type from the initializer alone, in which case adding one is redundant. Explicit annotations still earn their keep on empty arrays, function parameters, and public API boundaries, where there is no initializer for the compiler to infer from, or where being explicit documents intent.',

Iterating with `for...in` instead enumerates an object's keys as `string`s and is rarely used with typed arrays, since `for...of` already gives typed access to the elements themselves.",

        '`const message = "TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript."` has no annotation, yet the compiler still infers `message` has the literal-widened type `string` from its initializer, and will flag any later attempt to assign a number to it. Inference also flows through function return types, array literals, and generic type arguments when they are not written explicitly.\n\nUnder `strict` mode (the recommended baseline, enabled via `"strict": true` in `tsconfig.json`), inference becomes stricter still: variables with no initializer and no annotation are treated as implicitly `any` only if `noImplicitAny` is off, and `strictNullChecks` means `null`/`undefined` are not silently assignable to other inferred types. Relying on inference for local variables is idiomatic TypeScript; explicit annotations are reserved for places inference cannot reach.',

This lets a single function, interface, or class stay fully type-safe while working over many different element types, instead of duplicating the logic per type or falling back to `any`.\n\nGenerics can be constrained (`<T extends Person>`) to require the type argument satisfy some shape, and given defaults (`<T = string>`) for when no argument is supplied. Like all TypeScript types, generic parameters are erased at compile time — there is no runtime representation of `T`, so patterns like `new T()` or `typeof T` inside a generic function are not allowed.',
