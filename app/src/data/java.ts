        'A `package` statement, when present, must be the first non-comment declaration in the file. It groups related classes under a dotted namespace such as `com.example.anatomy`. Source trees conventionally mirror that name as `com/example/anatomy/JavaAnatomy.java`, and build tools generally expect the layout, though `javac` itself can compile an explicitly named source file from another location.\n\nClasses in the same package can reference each other without an import. Omitting the package statement entirely places the class in the unnamed "default package," which works for small experiments but is avoided by most real projects because named packages cannot import from it.',

Classes in the same package are likewise visible without an import.',

Java is statically typed, so every field's type is fixed at declaration and checked by the compiler.",

If a class defines no constructor at all, the compiler silently supplies a no-argument default constructor; that default disappears as soon as any constructor is written explicitly.',

A program can technically define `main` in more than one class, but only the class named on the command line (or in the JAR manifest) is used as the entry point.',

The `<Integer>` part is a generic type parameter that tells the compiler this list may only ever hold `Integer` values, catching type mismatches before the program runs.\n\nSince Java 10, the `var` keyword lets the compiler infer an obvious local variable's type from its initializer (`var numbers = new ArrayList<Integer>();`), saving typing without giving up static typing — the inferred type is still fixed and checked, `var` is purely a source-level shorthand.",

Java also has `while` (condition checked up front) and `do...while` (condition checked after the first pass, guaranteeing at least one iteration).\n\nThe enhanced for-loop, `for (Integer n : numbers) { ... }`, iterates directly over any array or `Iterable` without manual indexing. `break` exits the nearest loop immediately, and `continue` skips straight to the next iteration's check.",
