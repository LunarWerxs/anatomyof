        "Every Haskell file belongs to a module, declared with `module Name (exports) where` at the top of the file. The parenthesized export list controls what other modules can see; anything left out stays private to the module, which is Haskell's main tool for encapsulation.\n\nOmitting the export list (`module Main where`) exports everything defined in the file. By convention the module name mirrors the file path, so `Data.Map` lives in `Data/Map.hs` — the compiler enforces this for anything beyond a simple `Main` module.",

        '`type Radius = Double` introduces a synonym: `Radius` and `Double` are completely interchangeable to the compiler and to type inference. Aliases exist purely to make signatures more readable and self-documenting — they carry no runtime cost and no extra type safety.\n\nBecause a type alias is not a distinct type, it cannot be used to prevent mixing up a `Radius` and a plain `Double` by accident. When that distinction matters, Haskell offers `newtype`, which wraps a value in a genuinely new type that is erased at compile time but still checked separately.',

The `|` separates alternative constructors, making `Shape` a sum type, while the fields carried by each constructor make it a product type — hence "algebraic."\n\nADTs are the backbone of data modeling in Haskell. Combined with pattern matching, they let the compiler check exhaustiveness — if a function forgets to handle one of `Shape`\'s constructors, GHC can warn about it at compile time, before the program ever runs.',

        '`calculateArea :: Shape -> Double` reads as "calculateArea is a function from Shape to Double." Signatures are optional — Hindley-Milner type inference can determine most types on its own — but they are considered essential style: a signature documents intent and turns a whole class of mistakes into compile errors instead of runtime surprises.\n\nBecause Haskell is purely functional, a signature also tells you a lot about what a function can and cannot do. A function typed `Int -> Int` cannot perform IO or throw a checked exception; any side effect has to show up in the type, usually via `IO` somewhere in the signature.',

Clauses are tried top to bottom, and GHC's exhaustiveness checking can flag patterns that were never covered.",

The part after `|` can include multiple generators and boolean filters, e.g. `[x * y | x <- xs, y <- ys, x /= y]`, giving a compact notation borrowed directly from set-builder notation in mathematics.\n\nList comprehensions are syntactic sugar over `map`, `filter`, and `concatMap` — the compiler desugars them into ordinary function calls, so there is no performance difference, only a difference in how readable the intent is at the call site.',

Because Haskell is purely functional, all interaction with the outside world — printing, reading input, file access — is threaded through the `IO` type, which marks a computation as impure right in its signature.\n\nThe `do` block is syntactic sugar for chaining `IO` actions (and other monadic values) sequentially. `let` inside a `do` block binds a local name without needing `in`, and each subsequent line runs after the previous action completes.',
