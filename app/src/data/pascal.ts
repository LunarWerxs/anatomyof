      details:
        'A Pascal executable commonly starts with a `program` heading followed by an identifier and semicolon. The name documents the compilation unit and may be used by tooling, but it is not a function that the runtime calls.\n\nA unit uses `unit Name;` instead and exposes an `interface` plus an `implementation`. Libraries can use `library Name;`. The final punctuation also changes by role: a complete program or unit finishes with `end.` — the period is part of the syntax, not prose.',

        'Compiler directives are instructions consumed during compilation rather than statements executed at runtime. `{$mode objfpc}` enables Free Pascal’s Object Pascal dialect, while `{$H+}` selects long `AnsiString` values for the unqualified `string` type.\n\nDirectives can also enable checks, define conditional symbols, or include files. Their exact set is implementation-specific, so portable code uses them sparingly and keeps dialect assumptions explicit near the top of the file.',

        '`uses SysUtils;` makes the public interface of the `SysUtils` unit visible to this program. A comma-separated list can import multiple units, and the compiler follows those dependencies before compiling or linking the current unit.\n\nUnlike a textual include, a unit has a compiled interface and its own initialization/finalization lifecycle. Name conflicts can be resolved with a qualified name such as `SysUtils.Format`.',

By convention, Pascal type names begin with `T`; the convention is widespread but not enforced by the compiler.\n\nClass instances live on the heap and variables hold references to them. In Free Pascal and Delphi-style code, creating an instance with a constructor is normally paired with an explicit `Free` call, often protected by `try...finally`.',
