        "`import { calculateTax } from './utils.js'` pulls a named export into the current module's scope. ES module imports are static and hoisted: they are resolved and linked before any code in the file runs, which is what lets bundlers perform tree-shaking.\n\nA default export is imported without braces (`import utils from './utils.js'`), and `import * as ns from './utils.js'` gathers every export onto a namespace object. Node and modern browsers require either a `.mjs` extension, `\"type\": \"module\"` in `package.json`, or a `<script type=\"module\">` tag to treat a file as an ES module rather than CommonJS.",

      body: 'Declares variables using `const` (constant) or `let` (reassignable).',
      details:
        '`const` and `let` are block-scoped: the variable only exists within the nearest enclosing `{}`, and both sit in a "temporal dead zone" from the top of that block until their declaration line, so referencing them earlier throws a `ReferenceError` instead of silently yielding `undefined`. `const` prevents reassignment of the binding itself, though objects and arrays it points to remain mutable.\n\nThe older `var` keyword is function-scoped (or global) rather than block-scoped, and declarations are hoisted with an initial value of `undefined`, which historically caused bugs inside loops and conditionals. Modern JavaScript style favors `const` by default and `let` only when reassignment is needed, avoiding `var` entirely.',

        'A `function` declaration is hoisted in full, so it can be called earlier in the file than where it is written. It gets its own `this`, determined by how it is called (as a method, standalone, or via `call`/`apply`/`bind`), and it can be used as a constructor with `new`.\n\nInside a function, `return` immediately produces a value and exits; without one the function implicitly returns `undefined`. Parameters can have default values (`function f(x = 1)`) and rest syntax (`function f(...args)`) to collect any remaining arguments into an array.',

Because `for...of` and `.forEach()`/`.map()` create a fresh binding per iteration when the loop variable is declared with `let` or `const`, closures created inside the loop body correctly capture each iteration's own value.",

The ternary operator (`cond ? a : b`) offers a compact expression form for simple branches.\n\n`switch` compares a value against several `case`s using strict equality (`===`) and falls through to subsequent cases unless each ends in `break`. Optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`) let common conditional-access patterns be written without an explicit `if`.',

Shorthand syntax lets `{ name }` stand in for `{ name: name }`, and computed keys (`{ [key]: value }`) let a variable supply the property name.\n\nSpreading another object into a literal (`{ ...defaults, override: true }`) produces a shallow copy with selected properties overridden, a common pattern for immutable updates. Object literals are also the shape returned by functions that need to hand back multiple named values at once.',

        'Arrow functions have no implicit parameters beyond what is listed and, crucially, no own `this`, `arguments`, or `super` — they capture `this` lexically from the enclosing scope, which avoids the classic `var self = this` workaround needed with regular functions inside callbacks. A single expression body (`(x) => x * 2`) implicitly returns that value; a block body (`(x) => { return x * 2 }`) requires an explicit `return`.\n\nBecause they lack their own `this`, arrow functions cannot be used as constructors (`new` throws) and are a poor fit for object methods that rely on the calling object. They shine as short callbacks passed to `.map()`, `.filter()`, event handlers, and Promise chains.',
