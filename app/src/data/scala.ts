Unlike Java, a single file can declare multiple nested packages with curly-brace syntax, though the one-package-per-file style shown here is far more common.\n\nScala also supports package objects (`package object scala { ... }`) for holding values and functions that do not belong inside any single class, giving a package its own top-level members the way a module would in other languages.',

This is how Scala gets rid of Java\'s `static` keyword entirely — anything you would have made static in Java becomes a member of an `object` instead.\n\nA common pattern pairs an `object` with a `class` of the same name (a "companion object"), which gets privileged access to the class\'s private members and is the idiomatic home for factory methods and constants related to that type.',

It is the fastest way to write a runnable Scala program, especially for scripts and small tools.\n\nThe trade-off is that `App` relies on the "delayed init" trick to run constructor statements as the body, which can behave subtly differently under the JVM\'s JIT than an explicit `def main`; production code and anything performance-sensitive typically defines `main` directly instead.',

Scala keeps `new` mandatory for ordinary classes, though case classes (declared with `case class`) get a compiler-generated companion factory so they can be constructed without it, e.g. `Person("Alice", 30)`.\n\nCase classes also get free structural equality, `hashCode`, `toString`, and a `copy` method out of the box, which is why they, rather than `new`-instantiated plain classes, are the idiomatic choice for simple data-holding types in Scala.',
