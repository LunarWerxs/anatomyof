This is different from most languages, where the file name is cosmetic.\n\nOlder MATLAB versions required exactly one function per file (with `local functions` as the exception covered below); modern MATLAB relaxed this so scripts can define multiple functions too, but the one-file-one-name rule for the primary function still holds.',

      details:
        '`if`/`elseif`/`else` blocks are closed with a matching `end`, not indentation or braces — indentation in MATLAB is purely cosmetic (the editor auto-indents it, but the parser does not care). Conditions are typically scalar logical expressions; if you hand `if` a non-scalar array it is only true when *every* element is nonzero, which surprises newcomers coming from element-wise languages.\n\n`disp(...)` prints a value without echoing the variable name, making it the go-to for user-facing status messages inside conditionals, as opposed to leaving a bare unsuppressed expression to auto-print.',

        '`for i = 1:length(processedData)` iterates `i` over each value of the range `1:length(...)`, and — like every block in MATLAB — the loop is terminated with `end` rather than a closing brace. Ranges use `start:stop` (step 1 implied) or `start:step:stop`, and are themselves ordinary row-vector values you can inspect or reuse.\n\nBecause MATLAB is built around whole-array operations, an explicit `for` looping over individual elements is often a sign the same work could be "vectorized" into a single matrix expression instead — vectorized code is idiomatic and usually faster, so seasoned MATLAB developers reach for loops mainly when the per-element logic cannot be expressed as one.',
