      body: 'Prevents commands from being displayed in the console.',
      details:
        'By default, `cmd.exe` echoes every command it executes to the console before running it, which clutters output meant for the user. `@echo off` disables that echoing for the rest of the script, and the leading `@` additionally suppresses echo of the `echo off` command itself.\n\nWithout the leading `@`, the line `echo off` would still print once before taking effect. Any individual line can override the current echo state by prefixing it with `@`, regardless of the script-wide setting.',

      body: 'Lines ignored by the interpreter.',
      details:
        '`REM` is the documented comment command; anything after it on the line is ignored. `::` is a widely used trick that works because it is parsed as a malformed label, which `cmd.exe` silently skips when not the target of a `goto`.\n\nThe two are not fully interchangeable: `::` cannot appear inside a parenthesized block like an `if` or `for` body without breaking parsing, whereas `REM` can. Trailing `&` command separators after `REM` are also treated as part of the comment, while `::` does not support that.',

      title: 'Variable set & expansion',
      body: 'Defines and uses variables (set VAR=... / %VAR%).',
      details:
        '`set VAR=value` defines an environment variable, and `%VAR%` expands it at parse time, before the line executes. This normal expansion breaks down inside loops and blocks whose body is parsed all at once, since every `%VAR%` on the block is substituted before any of it runs.\n\nDelayed expansion fixes that: `setlocal EnableDelayedExpansion` turns on `!VAR!` syntax, which is resolved at execution time instead, line by line. `setlocal` also scopes variable changes to the current script so they do not leak into the parent shell once it exits.',

      details:
        "`echo` and `set` are built-in shell commands implemented directly by `cmd.exe`, unlike external commands such as `robocopy.exe` which are separate executables resolved via `PATH`. Built-ins run without spawning a new process, so they are cheaper and unaffected by the current directory's executable search order.\n\nArguments are separated by whitespace and `%VARIABLE%` references are expanded before the command runs. Special characters like `&`, `|`, `^`, and `%` often need escaping or quoting to be passed through literally.",

      title: 'Command-line argument',
      body: 'Accesses arguments passed to the script (%1, %2, ...).',
      details:
        '`%1` through `%9` refer to the first nine arguments passed to the script; `%0` holds the script\'s own path. `%*` expands to all arguments at once, which is useful for forwarding them unchanged to another command.\n\nThe `shift` command shifts every positional parameter down by one, so `%1` takes on the value that used to be `%2`, which lets a script step through more than nine arguments in a loop. Argument values are substituted as raw text, so testing them against an empty string is usually written as `if "%1"=="" (...)` to avoid a syntax error when no argument was supplied.',

      title: 'Conditional flow',
      body: 'Executes code based on a condition (if ... ( ... ) goto ...).',
      details:
        '`if` tests a condition and, when true, runs the parenthesized block that follows; `cmd.exe` parses the whole block as a single unit before executing any of it. Comparisons are done with `==` for strings (optionally case-insensitively with `/i`), or with switches like `/exist` for files and `errorlevel` for exit codes.\n\nThere is no `elif`; additional branches are chained with `) else if ... (` or nested `if` statements. Because the entire block is parsed up front, variables that change inside it need delayed expansion (`!VAR!`) to be read reliably within the same block.',

      details:
        '`for /L %%i in (start,step,end) do (...)` counts from `start` to `end` in increments of `step`, similar to a numeric `for` loop in other languages. In a script file the loop variable uses a doubled percent sign, `%%i`, whereas typed directly at an interactive prompt a single `%i` is used.\n\nOther `for` variants iterate over different sources: plain `for %%f in (*.txt) do` walks a set of files, and `for /F` parses lines of output from a command or file, splitting them into tokens. Like `if`, the loop body is parsed as one block, so delayed expansion is often needed to see updated variable values on each iteration.',

      body: 'Marks a point in the script (:label) and jumps to it.',
      details:
        'A line starting with a single colon, such as `:end`, defines a label — a named jump target that `cmd.exe` does not execute as a command. `goto :end` transfers control directly to that label, skipping everything in between, which is commonly used to implement early exits or simple error handling.\n\nLabels also double as subroutine entry points: `call :label` jumps to the label and, unlike a plain `goto`, returns to the line after the `call` once the subroutine reaches `exit /b` or falls off the end of the script. This makes `call`/label pairs the closest thing batch has to functions.',

      title: 'Pause & exit',
      body: 'Pauses execution and exits with a status code.',
      details:
        '`pause` prints "Press any key to continue . . ." and halts the script until a key is pressed, which is often used so a console window opened by double-clicking a `.bat` file does not close immediately. `exit /b 0` ends the script and sets the process exit code to 0.\n\nThe `/b` flag is significant: without it, `exit` closes the entire `cmd.exe` process (including an interactive shell that invoked the script), whereas `/b` exits only the current batch script or subroutine. The value passed to `exit /b` becomes `%ERRORLEVEL%` in the caller, which other scripts commonly check to detect success or failure.',
