      details:
        'Every COBOL source unit opens with the `IDENTIFICATION DIVISION`, the mandatory first of the four divisions (`IDENTIFICATION`, `ENVIRONMENT`, `DATA`, `PROCEDURE`). It exists purely for bookkeeping: it names the program and can optionally record author, install date, and remarks, none of which affect runtime behavior.\n\nHistorically this division carried paragraphs like `AUTHOR.` and `DATE-WRITTEN.` for shop documentation standards. Modern compilers still accept them but treat them as comments in all but name — the only clause with teeth is `PROGRAM-ID`.',

      details:
        'The `PROGRAM-ID.` paragraph gives the compilation unit a name, which becomes the external entry point other programs use to `CALL` it, and often becomes the name of the compiled load module. Traditionally this name was limited to 8 characters to match old operating-system dataset naming rules, a legacy constraint that still shapes naming conventions in mainframe shops today.\n\nBecause COBOL predates the idea of a single "main" function, `PROGRAM-ID` is the closest analogue: whatever name it declares is what a job control language (JCL) step or another COBOL program invokes to start execution here.',

        "The `ENVIRONMENT DIVISION` is where COBOL admits that hardware exists. Its `CONFIGURATION SECTION` records the `SOURCE-COMPUTER` (where the program is compiled) and `OBJECT-COMPUTER` (where it runs) — vestiges of an era when compiling and running happened on genuinely different machines.\n\nA larger `INPUT-OUTPUT SECTION` (not shown here) uses `FILE-CONTROL` to bind logical file names in the program to physical datasets or paths, decoupling the `DATA DIVISION`'s view of a file from wherever the operating system actually stores it.",

        "The `DATA DIVISION` is COBOL's answer to variable declarations: every piece of storage the program will touch — files, records, working variables, screen layouts — must be described here before `PROCEDURE DIVISION` can reference it. There is no equivalent to declaring a variable inline at first use.\n\nIts major sections include `FILE SECTION` (record layouts for files opened via `FILE-CONTROL`), `WORKING-STORAGE SECTION` (program variables), and `LINKAGE SECTION` (parameters passed in from a caller). Declaring data this exhaustively up front is part of why COBOL programs read as verbose but are famously explicit about memory layout.",

        'Items declared in `WORKING-STORAGE SECTION` are allocated once and retain their values across the whole run (or, in a called subprogram, across calls unless it terminates) — closer in spirit to static storage than to stack locals. Each item is a fixed-width field whose size is fully determined at compile time by its `PICTURE` clause.\n\nBecause COBOL has no dynamic heap allocation in the C sense, `WORKING-STORAGE` is where nearly all of a traditional program\'s "variables" live, initialized with `VALUE` clauses rather than assignment statements executed at runtime.',

      details:
        "The level number (`01`, `05`, `10`, ...) establishes a data item's place in a hierarchy, letting a group item (like a customer record) contain elementary items (like name and balance) the way a struct contains fields — `01` always marks a top-level record or standalone item. Numbers need not be consecutive; the gaps conventionally leave room to insert fields later without renumbering everything.\n\nThe `PICTURE` clause (abbreviated `PIC`) is COBOL's type system: `X` marks alphanumeric characters, `9` marks a numeric digit, and `V` marks an implied decimal point that consumes no storage. So `PIC 9(5)` is five digits and `PIC X(12)` is twelve characters of text, with `VALUE` optionally supplying an initial literal.",

It is organized into paragraphs (optionally grouped into sections), which are executed either by falling through from the previous paragraph or by explicit `PERFORM`, COBOL's primary mechanism for structured control transfer without an unstructured `GOTO`.\n\nA `PROCEDURE DIVISION` can also declare `USING` parameters when the program is meant to be `CALL`ed as a subprogram, mirroring the parameter list a function would take in more modern languages.",

Paragraphs are COBOL\'s original unit of reusable logic, invoked with `PERFORM paragraph-name` and returning control automatically when the paragraph finishes.\n\nBefore structured programming conventions took hold, paragraphs were often chained with `GO TO`, producing famously tangled control flow; modern style favors `PERFORM` almost exclusively, and many shops ban `GO TO` outright in their coding standards.',

TO ...` performs arithmetic in place. A sentence is one or more statements terminated by a period, though modern style favors scope terminators like `END-IF` over relying on the period's effect.\n\nThis verb-first, prose-like syntax was a deliberate design goal from COBOL's 1959 CODASYL specification: management was meant to be able to read the code even without knowing how to write it.",

Code proper starts in the "Area A/B" columns beyond that.\n\nFree-format COBOL (COBOL 2002 and later, widely supported by modern compilers like GnuCOBOL) relaxes these column rules and adds an inline `*>` comment marker that can start anywhere on a line, much like `//` in C-family languages.',
