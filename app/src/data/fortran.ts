        'Free-form Fortran (`.f90`/`.f95`) uses `!` to start a comment anywhere on a line, from the first column through end of line. This replaced the fixed-form rule where a `C` or `*` in column 1 marked an entire line as a comment, which is why old Fortran listings look so column-obsessed.\n\nThere is no block-comment syntax; every commented line needs its own `!`. In practice this means decades of scientific codebases are annotated one line at a time, often by whoever last touched the subroutine and lived to explain it.',

Other program units pull in a module's contents with a `use` statement rather than textual `include`.\n\nModules compile to `.mod` files that encode interfaces, so the compiler checks argument types and counts across module boundaries — a huge reliability win over the implicit-interface calling conventions of FORTRAN 77.",

It is considered mandatory in any code written after roughly 1990.',

The compiler rejects programs that violate the declared intent.\n\nBeyond safety, `intent` lets the compiler optimize argument passing (e.g. it need not copy an `intent(in)` array back to the caller) and gives tooling enough information to catch an accidental write to what should have been read-only input.',
