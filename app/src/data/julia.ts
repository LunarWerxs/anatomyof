Names declared inside are qualified as `MyMath.distance` from the outside unless explicitly exported with `export`, which keeps unrelated packages from stepping on each other's `sqrt` or `distance` bindings.\n\nModules can `using` or `import` other modules, and nesting them mirrors how Julia's own standard library is organized (`Base`, `Core`, `Statistics`). Unlike a Python module, a Julia module is not tied one-to-one with a file — a single file can define several, though convention keeps it to one per package entry point.",

        "`using Statistics` brings a module's exported names into scope directly, so `mean(x)` works unqualified — this is the common case for standard-library and package code. `import Statistics` instead requires qualification (`Statistics.mean`) unless you explicitly extend a function, which is the idiom for adding methods to someone else's generic function.\n\nBoth trigger Julia's package precompilation the first time a module is loaded in a session, caching compiled code so subsequent `using` statements in later sessions start faster. This is also why the first call to a freshly loaded function can feel slow: the JIT compiler is specializing it for the actual argument types.",

Prefixing with `mutable struct` opts back into reassignable fields at the cost of that optimization.\n\nJulia generates a default positional constructor automatically — `Point(1.0, 2.0)` — matching the field declaration order. Structs carry no methods of their own; behavior lives in standalone functions dispatched on the struct's type, which is the core of Julia's multiple-dispatch design.",

Annotations are optional almost everywhere — Julia infers types at compile time from whatever is actually passed — but they document intent and let multiple dispatch pick a more specific method.\n\nOmitting an annotation is not "untyped" the way a dynamically typed language usually means it; the field or argument is simply typed `Any`, and the compiler still specializes generated code per call site based on the concrete runtime types it sees.',

The final evaluated expression is returned implicitly, though an explicit `return` (as in `distance`) is common for clarity or early exit.\n\nBecause Julia dispatches on argument types, the same function name can have many methods — `distance(p1::Point, p2::Point)` coexists with, say, `distance(p1::Point3D, p2::Point3D)` — and Julia picks the most specific applicable method at each call site. This is multiple dispatch, and it is the feature the rest of the language's design orbits.",

This is closer to shell or Perl interpolation than to Python\'s `f"{...}"`, though it serves the same purpose.\n\nInterpolation works in both regular double-quoted strings and command backtick-strings, and a literal `$` in a string must be escaped as `\\$` to avoid triggering it.',

Ranges like `1:3` are lazy and allocation-free, so looping over even a huge range costs no more memory than looping over `1:3`.",

The block still ends with a single `end`, matching every other block construct in the language.\n\nFor simple cases, the ternary `cond ? a : b` and short-circuiting `&&` / `||` (often used for guard clauses like `x < 0 && return`) cover what would otherwise need a full `if` block.',
