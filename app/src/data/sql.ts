        '`CREATE TABLE` is DDL (Data Definition Language): it describes structure rather than manipulating rows. Each column is given a name and a data type (`INTEGER`, `VARCHAR(n)`, `DECIMAL(p,s)`, `DATE`, `TIMESTAMP`, etc.), and the engine enforces that type on every value stored in it.\n\nDDL statements are typically auto-committed and, in most engines, cannot be rolled back as easily as ordinary data changes — which is part of why schema changes usually go through migration tooling rather than being run ad hoc.',

This pushes correctness into the database itself instead of relying solely on application code to get it right.",

A single `INSERT` can supply multiple `VALUES` tuples to add several rows in one statement.\n\nColumns omitted from the column list fall back to their `DEFAULT` (or `NULL`, if no default and no `NOT NULL` constraint blocks it). Most engines also support `INSERT ... SELECT` to copy rows from a query result straight into another table.',

The `SET` clause can update several columns at once, separated by commas, and may reference the row's own current values, e.g. `SET amount = amount * 1.1`.\n\nOmitting the `WHERE` clause updates every row in the table, which is a classic way to turn a Tuesday afternoon into an incident report. Most teams wrap ad hoc `UPDATE`s in a transaction specifically so they stay reversible until confirmed correct.",

It cannot reference aggregate functions like `SUM(...)` directly — that restriction is what `HAVING` exists for.\n\nBecause `WHERE` runs early in logical evaluation, filtering here (rather than after a `JOIN` produces a huge intermediate result) is usually what lets the query planner use an index instead of scanning every row.',

        '`GROUP BY` collapses rows sharing the same value(s) in the given columns into single groups, so aggregate functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, and `AVG` can be computed per group instead of over the whole table. Every non-aggregated column in `SELECT` must appear in the `GROUP BY` list in standard SQL.\n\n`HAVING` is `WHERE` for groups: it filters based on the aggregate result, e.g. `HAVING SUM(o.amount) > 10`, after the grouping has already happened. Trying to write that same condition in `WHERE` fails, since `WHERE` runs before aggregates exist.',

Common table expressions (`WITH name AS (SELECT ...)`) often express the same logic more readably.",

This is the "atomicity" in ACID: partial failures do not leave the data half-changed.\n\nMany engines auto-commit each statement by default when no explicit transaction is open, so wrapping related `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE` statements in one transaction is what makes multi-step changes safe to retry or abort as a single group.',
