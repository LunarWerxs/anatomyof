        'The `ns` macro declares a namespace and, in the same breath, pulls in everything the file needs: `:require` loads other Clojure namespaces (optionally aliased with `:as`), `:import` brings in Java classes, and `:refer` pulls specific symbols into the current namespace so they can be used unqualified. A namespace usually maps one-to-one with a file path (`my-app.core` lives at `my_app/core.clj`, underscored per JVM classloader rules).\n\nBecause the JVM is the host, namespaces are ultimately just Java packages/classes under the hood, but you rarely think about that when writing idiomatic Clojure. Convention keeps `ns` as the very first form in the file, since almost everything below depends on what it requires.',

Multi-line docstrings are just regular Clojure strings, so newlines are written literally between the quotes.\n\nDocstrings are metadata, not comments — they are compiled into the running program and available for tooling like `clojure.repl/doc`, cider, or generated API docs, whereas a `;` comment is stripped before the reader ever sees it.",

Two or three semicolons are a style convention for emphasis, not a different syntax.\n\nThe `(comment ...)` special form is a different beast: it is a real form the reader parses like any other, but it macro-expands to `nil` and never evaluates its body. That makes it a popular "rich comment block" for stashing scratch expressions you want to `eval` individually at the REPL without them running when the file loads.',

Vectors show up constantly outside of "data" too: function argument lists (`[name]`) and `let` binding pairs (`[greeting (str ...)]`) are both vectors.\n\nBecause vectors are ordered and lists are not treated as code by default, Clojure uses the bracket shape itself as a signal: `[1 2 3]` is inert data, while `(1 2 3)` would be read as an attempt to call `1` as a function.',

The last expression in the body is the return value — there is no `return` keyword, because everything in Clojure is an expression.\n\n`defn` also supports arity overloading (multiple `[params] body` pairs in one function) and variadic args via `&`, e.g. `[x & rest]`, letting one function name handle several call shapes.',

        '`let` takes a vector of alternating name/value pairs and a body, introducing local bindings that are visible only within that body. Bindings are evaluated left to right, so a later binding in the same vector can refer to an earlier one — `[a 1 b (inc a)]` is perfectly legal.\n\nLike everything else in Clojure, these locals are immutable once bound: there is no reassignment, only shadowing a name in a nested scope or threading a new value through a recursive call with `loop`/`recur`.',

Symbols can be namespace-qualified with a slash (`str/capitalize` means "the `capitalize` var in the `str`-aliased namespace"), which is how required namespaces are actually used after `:require ... :as str`.\n\nUnlike a keyword, a symbol does not evaluate to itself — evaluating the symbol `greet` looks up whatever `greet` is bound to. Quoting a symbol with a leading apostrophe (e.g. `\'greet`) suppresses that lookup and yields the symbol itself as data, which is central to how macros manipulate code.',
