It acts on whatever is selected, so its buttons enable and disable as the selection changes.\n\nKeeping destructive actions (delete) slightly apart from everyday ones (archive) reduces misclicks, and the most common action, search, usually gets the most prominent slot.',

Some clients use foldering (a message lives in one place) and others labels (a message can carry many), but the navigational role is the same.',
