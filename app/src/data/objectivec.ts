Both are stripped before compilation and have no effect on the compiled binary whatsoever.\n\nHeader files (`.h`) lean on comments especially heavily, since they are the public contract of a class — the declarations a `.m` implementation file promises to fulfill. A well-commented header often serves as the only documentation a consumer of a framework ever reads.",

It is otherwise textual substitution performed by the same preprocessor pass C uses.",

The leading underscore is a long-standing convention signaling "backing storage, do not touch directly," reserving the un-prefixed name for a property\'s public accessor.\n\nModern Objective-C rarely hand-declares ivars for properties, since `@property` auto-synthesizes a matching underscored ivar for you. Explicit ivars still show up for state that should never be exposed through a property at all.',

The parenthesized attributes configure the generated accessors: `nonatomic` skips the overhead of thread-safe locking (the default, `atomic`, adds it), and `strong` tells Automatic Reference Counting to retain the object for as long as this property holds it.\n\nOther common attributes include `weak` (a non-owning reference that zeroes itself out when the object is deallocated, avoiding retain cycles) and `copy` (favored for `NSString` so a mutable string handed in later can't change value out from under you). `@synthesize` used to be required to wire a property to its ivar; the compiler has generated it implicitly since Xcode 4.4.",

The parenthesized type before the selector fragment is the return type, and each labeled colon segment (`name:`, `age:`) is part of the method's full selector name.\n\nUnlike C++ or Java, Objective-C selectors are not overloaded by parameter type alone — `personWithName:age:` is one indivisible name, and every keyword before a colon is meant to read like a sentence describing what the call does. This is the readability trade-off for the verbosity Objective-C is famous (or infamous) for.",

By convention this block lives in the `.m` ("message" or "methods") file, kept separate from the `.h` header so consumers of a class see only its public shape, not its internals.\n\nA class\'s interface and implementation can even disagree slightly: a "class extension" (`@interface Person () @end` in the `.m` file) can declare additional private properties or methods visible only within the implementation file, a common pattern for hiding internal state from the public header.',

Any initializer that skips the `if (self)` guard risks configuring an object that failed to initialize, so the pattern shown here is close to mandatory rather than stylistic.',

        '`self` inside an instance method refers to the object the message was sent to, analogous to `this` in C++ or Java. Inside a class method, `self` instead refers to the class object itself, which is why `[self alloc]` inside a `+` method allocates an instance of whatever class actually received the call, correctly supporting subclasses without being hard-coded.\n\n`self.name` reads through the synthesized accessor (calling `-name`), which is a meaningfully different operation than reaching directly for the ivar `_name` — the accessor path respects `strong`/`copy`/`weak` memory semantics and any custom logic layered into a hand-written setter, while direct ivar access bypasses all of it.',

        '`NSLog(@"Hello, my name is %@ and I am %ld years old.", self.name, (long)_age);` writes a timestamped, process-tagged line to the console, formatted with `printf`-style conversion specifiers. `%@` is Objective-C\'s own addition to the format-string vocabulary: it calls `-description` on any Objective-C object and substitutes the resulting string, which is why `NSLog` can print an `NSString`, `NSArray`, or custom object without a manual `%s` and C-string conversion.\n\n`NSInteger` is a platform-dependent typedef (32-bit or 64-bit depending on the architecture), so `NSLog` has no single matching format specifier for it; casting to `(long)` and using `%ld` sidesteps the ambiguity entirely rather than guessing wrong on one architecture.',

      details:
        'Like plain C, execution begins at `int main(int argc, const char *argv[])`. Wrapping the body in `@autoreleasepool { ... }` establishes a pool that drains at the closing brace, deallocating any object that was sent `-autorelease` (directly, or indirectly through convenience constructors) inside that scope.\n\nUnder Automatic Reference Counting this pattern matters less for basic memory safety than it did under manual retain/release, but it still bounds the lifetime of temporary objects and keeps peak memory usage down in loops that create many short-lived objects, such as processing images or parsing large collections one autoreleased object at a time.',

        '`[bob sayHello];` is a message send: the runtime looks up `sayHello` in `bob`\'s class (and its superclasses) and invokes whatever it finds, resolved dynamically at runtime rather than bound at compile time the way a C function call is. `[Person personWithName:@"Bob" age:30];` shows the same syntax with a multi-part selector, each argument slotting after its matching colon-labeled keyword.\n\nBecause dispatch happens at runtime through the Objective-C runtime library, sending a message to `nil` is not a crash — it silently returns `nil`/`0`/`NO` — which is a deliberate design choice distinct from most C-family languages, where calling through a null pointer segfaults immediately.',
